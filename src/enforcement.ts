// Proof-of-Enforcement (PoE) — the keystone that turns ADP's `enforced` boolean
// into a CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY FALSIFIABLE claim. A self-asserted "enforced: true" is a
// promise; PoE makes it a checkable statement backed by OpenSolvency's deterministic,
// signed, replayable audit chain. OS *emits* a PoEAttestation, the OS→ADP builder
// *binds* a policyHash into the disclosure, and this module *verifies* the three legs:
//
//   bound    — the disclosed policyHash equals the policyHash the gate actually runs
//   fresh    — the attestation's live audit head matches / advances the disclosed anchor
//   replayed — sampled real decisions, re-executed under the disclosed policy, match
//              their signed verdicts (ANY mismatch ⇒ a false `enforced` claim is DETECTED)
//
// Dep-light by design: zod + node:crypto only. ADP does NOT import OpenSolvency — the
// gate-replay is an INJECTED seam (`opts.replay`), the canonical wiring being OS's pure
// `replayDecision`. The policyHash is computed with ADP's own `canonicalize` (RFC 8785 /
// JCS) + sha256, byte-identical to OS's `computePolicyHash`, so both sides hash the same
// EffectivePolicy to the same digest without sharing code.
